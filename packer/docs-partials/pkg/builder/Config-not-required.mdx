- `command_wrapper` (string) - Lets you prefix all builder commands, such as with ssh for a remote build host. Defaults to "".
  Copied from other builders :)

- `output_directory` (string) - Output directory, where the final image will be stored.
  Deprecated - Use OutputFile instead

- `output_filename` (string) - Output filename, where the final image will be stored

- `image_type` (utils.KnownImageType) - Image type. this is used to deduce other settings like image mounts and qemu args.
  If not provided, we will try to deduce it from the image url. (see autoDetectType())
  For list of valid values, see: pkg/image/utils/images.go

- `image_mounts` ([]string) - Where to mounts the image partitions in the chroot.
  first entry is the mount point of the first partition. etc..

- `mount_path` (string) - The path where the volume will be mounted. This is where the chroot environment will be.
  Will be a temporary directory if left unspecified.

- `chroot_mounts` ([][]string) - What directories mount from the host to the chroot.
  leave it empty for reasonable defaults.
  array of triplets: [type, device, mntpoint].

- `additional_chroot_mounts` ([][]string) - What directories mount from the host to the chroot, in addition to the default ones.
  Use this instead of `chroot_mounts` if you want to add to the existing defaults instead of
  overriding them
  array of triplets: [type, device, mntpoint].
  for example: `["bind", "/run/systemd", "/run/systemd"]`

- `resolv-conf` (ResolvConfBehavior) - Can be one of: off, copy-host, bind-host, delete. Defaults to off

- `last_partition_extra_size` (uint64) - Should the last partition be extended? this only works for the last partition in the
  dos partition table, and ext filesystem

- `target_image_size` (uint64) - The target size of the final image. The last partition will be extended to
  fill up this much room. I.e. if the generated image is 256MB and TargetImageSize
  is set to 384MB the last partition will be extended with an additional 128MB.

- `qemu_binary` (string) - Qemu binary to use. default is qemu-arm-static
  If this is an absolute path, it will be used. Otherwise, we will look for one in your PATH
  and finally, try to auto fetch one from https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static/

- `disable_embedded` (bool) - Do not use embedded qemu.

- `qemu_args` ([]string) - Arguments to qemu binary. default depends on the image type. see init() function above.
